## Is Rosetta Stone Worth It?

Is Rosetta Stone really as good as people say? I’ve used it for both Spanish and Japanese. I’d say it can be, depending on your goals.

The immersion approach is tough. You dive straight into the language with pictures and sounds, without any English.

After about two weeks, I could make simple sentences. The TrueAccent tool helped me sound more natural. Live coaching felt like chatting with a friend.

It’s not perfect. Sometimes the repeated lessons became boring, I wish for more cultural content. Still, for a clear way to learn, it’s hard to beat.

**At $199 for lifetime access,** it costs less than one college class! If you stay focused, Rosetta Stone can help you speak in just a few months.

### Rosetta Stone Key Features

Why pick Rosetta Stone?

Here’s why it stands out:

- **Dynamic Immersion®:** Dive in without translations. You learn by doing, just like a native speaker.
- **TrueAccent® Speech Recognition:** Get instant help to improve your pronunciation, like having a personal coach.
- **Live Coaching:** Take 25-minute lessons with native speakers to practice speaking in real situations.
- **Offline Access:** Download lessons on the app so you can learn anywhere, even without internet.
- **25+ Languages:** From Spanish to Tagalog, there’s a language for everyone.

I tried the Mandarin Chinese course myself, and the immersion style really caught my attention.

Listening to native speakers and copying their way of speaking helped me gain confidence in just a few weeks.
